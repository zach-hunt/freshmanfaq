<h4>Food:</h4>
<!-- 0 -->
<button class="collapsible">How many meals do I need?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>Downgrade your meal plan - most people eat less than they expect. I purchased 96 meals first semester and had extras. Plus, they run specials at the end of the year to add more meals/dollars.</p>
</div>

<!-- 1 -->
<button class="collapsible">Are the larger meal plans better deals?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>NO! The meals do get cheaper as you buy more, it's true, but it's about a 20 cent difference per meal when you double the number of meals. That's 2%. See "How many meals do I need?", above.</p>
</div>

<!-- 2 -->
<button class="collapsible">Where should I eat?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>There are around 45 places to eat on campus. Make <a href="https://www.dineoncampus.com/tamu/dining-map" target="_blank">a list</a> and start checking them out! You'll learn your way around, and you'll find a lot of gems.</p>
</div>

<!-- 3 -->
<button class="collapsible">When is food available?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>Dining locations on north campus tend to be open later. You can view hours <a href="https://www.dineoncampus.com/tamu/hours-of-operation" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
</div>

<!-- 4 -->
<button class="collapsible">What kinds of things are available to eat?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>Restaurants have varying menus which you can check out at <a href="https://www.dineoncampus.com/tamu/whats-on-the-menu" target="_blank">dineoncampus.com</a>.</p>
</div>

<!-- 5 -->
<button class="collapsible">What are meal trades?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>USELESS! Don't use them ever. Meals average $11.50, and you're trading them for a meal that would normally cost ~$6 dollars, even including fries, drinks, etc. Not worth it! Use dining dollars anywhere that's not a dining hall (meal swipes are sometimes worth it there: see below).</p>
</div>

<!-- 6 -->
<button class="collapsible">What about dining halls?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>There are three dining halls on campus: Sbisa (North), Commons (South), and Duncan (Corps). Even at the dining halls, using meals isn't always the best option. Ask the cashiers the dining dollar cost. Typically, it's cheaper to use dining dollars than meals swipes for breakfast, and sometimes lunch. (Dinner is usually worth the meal swipe.) This is a large reason behind why you probably need fewer meals than you think.</p>
</div>

<!-- 7 -->
<button class="collapsible">What's up with Duncan Dining Hall?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>Duncan is the dining hall for the Corps of Cadets. Non-corps students can eat there as well (though not every day), and I personally think you should, at least once. It's not the same quality, but it's interesting to see, and it makes for a fun story!</p>
</div>

<!-- 8 -->
<button class="collapsible">What's your favorite spot to eat?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>The Grill at the Pavilion - breakfast taco combo with sausage. $5.50 for two fantastic tacos. Served until 10am.<br>Azimuth Cafe in Langford - Tuscan Chicken. Fantastic warm sandwich. (Pro tip: you can order any sandwich on the menu grilled!)<br>Rev's American Grill - the Good Bull. I won't spoil the surprise :) (They also have good bean burgers and salads.)</p>
</div>
<br><br>
<h4>Parking:</h4>
<!-- 9 -->
<button class="collapsible">Should I get a parking pass?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>Parking passes are expensive, but you can return your parking pass to Koldus (by Kyle Field and the MSC) at the end of the year for a ~$100 refund! (It's prorated, so the sooner you return it, the more you get back.) (The refund is less for lots than garages, just because you paid less to begin with.) (Your other parking options are covered below - and they're not so great, usually.)</p>
</div>

<!-- 10 -->
<button class="collapsible">What are these emails from transportation services?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>Transportation services sends email for every football game. The short story is that South Side Garage doesn't have to move, and most southside lots are probably fine to stay. For other places, you should check the email.</p>
</div>

<!-- 11 -->
<button class="collapsible">Where can I park off campus?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>College Station is home to a thriving community of towing services. If you park in the IHOP/Hurricane Harry's parking lot north of Campus, and you're not going to one of those places, you will get towed. It's a great experience... :( (Also, the golf parking lot is off limits.)</p>
</div>
<br><br>
<h4>School Supplies:</h4>
<!-- 12 -->
<button class="collapsible">Where can I get textbooks?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p><a href="http://textbooksolutions.com" target="_blank">TextbookSolutions.com</a> is typically a lot cheaper than the bookstore. Not always, and they don't have everything, but it's right across from campus, so it's definitely worth checking.</p>
</div>

<!-- 13 -->
<button class="collapsible">When should I get textbooks?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>In my experience, you don't need actually most of the textbooks listed in your syllabuses. A lot are available electronically (see below about <a href="https://www.cengage.com/unlimited" target="_blank">Cengage Unlimited</a>). It's perfectly fine to wait until the first class period to get your books.</p>
</div>

<!-- 14 -->
<button class="collapsible">Can I order my textbooks online?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>You can, but you shouldn't. When you purchase textbooks from Barnes & Noble (the bookstore), they just pack your order from the shelves and make you come pick it up, but it takes several days. Just go downstairs MSC and pick them up the first week of class.</p>
</div>

<!-- 15 -->
<button class="collapsible">Where can I get scantrons?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>Scantrons are 42.8% cheaper at the bookstore than the Aggie Expresses. Buy 10, leave 1 in your bag.</p>
</div>

<!-- 16 -->
<button class="collapsible">Do I need Cengage Unlimited?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p><a href="https://www.cengage.com/unlimited" target="_blank">Cengage Unlimited</a> (2 Yr.) is almost certainly worth it for you. (Plus, it's $65 cheaper than in 2018!) (This applies to engineers, for sure. Others, do the math - you could save big.)</p>
</div>

<!-- 17 -->
<button class="collapsible">Does the bookstore sell other stuff?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>Predictably, TAMU will sell you any merch or school supplies you could possibly want. Also predictably, it's substantially more expensive than Amazon or Walmart. Don't get your calculators or notebooks from there.</p>
</div>

<!-- 18 -->
<button class="collapsible">Do I need a new calculator?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>Maybe. A lot of classes will list specific calculator restrictions for exams, but those are frequently just suggestions. Check with your TA/Professor - there's a good chance they'll say what you have is great.</p>
</div>

<!-- 19 -->
<button class="collapsible">What other supplies do I need?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>Umbrella. Is that a school supply? Definitely. I'm not joking. You won't need it, and you'll think I'm crazy, right up until the day that it saves your life. Get one.</p>
</div>
<br><br>
<h4>Academics:</h4>
<!-- 20 -->
<button class="collapsible">Any tips for finals?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>I'm glad you asked! If you have more than two finals on one day, you can reschedule at least one of them. (This is <a href="https://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule08/" target="_blank">Student Rule 8.4</a>.) You can check the finals schedule on the <a href="http://registrar.tamu.edu/Courses,-Registration,-Scheduling/Final-Examination-Schedules" target="_blank">Registrar's Website</a>.</p>
</div>

<!-- 21 -->
<button class="collapsible">What should I do during the first week?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>The people that have a fun first week have a fun first week. The people that do homework as soon as they get it, just for the first week, have a fun first semester. Up to you, but starting and staying ahead is a lot easier than getting ahead from behind. On the flip side, be sure to explore (get lost on) campus and make friends. They're everwhere!</p>
</div>

<!-- 22 -->
<button class="collapsible">Where can I study?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>Everywhere! You'll see people in the fields, on the stairs, in classrooms, in breakout rooms, in the library, in hammocks, in the dining halls, and in their dorms. It seriously pays to see what works for you. Try different things!</p>
</div>

<!-- 23 -->
<button class="collapsible">What should I do if I'm behind?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>Apply the 80/20 rule. Identify the most high impact activities (whether studying or homework or whatever), and resolve to do one. Leave your dorm! Otherwise, you'll constantly fall off topic. Seriously, leave. (Also, leave everything you don't need - laptop/phone/tablet. You will survive. It's strangely freeing.). If you feel like you're struggling in general, A&M has a lot of resources to help - they want you to succeed. Talk to your RA or advisor. Most profs are quite helpful as well.</p>
</div>

<!-- 24 -->
<button class="collapsible">How do I keep track of my classes?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>Take a screenshot of your schedule. Howdy can and will go down, and you'll be glad you did. A lot of people set their schedule as their phone background.</p>
</div>

<!-- 25 -->
<button class="collapsible">How do I contact profs?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>Professor's email addresses are always listed in their syllabus, in the <a href="http://directory.tamu.edu" target="_blank">directory</a>, on <a href="http://howdy.tamu.edu" target="_blank">Howdy</a>, and on the department's website.</p>
</div>

<!-- 26 -->
<button class="collapsible">Where are syllabuses?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>Class syllabi are typically posted under your course in eCampus (<a href="https://tamu.blackboard.com" target="_blank">Blackboard</a>), but that can take a while, and they're always in <a href="http://howdy.tamu.edu" target="_blank">Howdy</a>.</p>
</div>
<br><br>
<h4>Life:</h4>
<!-- 27 -->
<button class="collapsible">How do I find my way around?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>Get lost intentionally - that's how you avoid doing it accidentally in the future. Also, use <a href="http://aggiemap.tamu.edu" target="_blank">aggiemap.tamu.edu</a> for finding buildings and the very helpful <a href="http://www.aggiemaps.com" target="_blank">aggiemaps.com</a> to understand the bus system.</p>
</div>

<!-- 28 -->
<button class="collapsible">What orgs should I join?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>The Navigators are a great Bible study organization, and we'd love to get you involved. Check out <a href="http://www.AggieNavs.org" target="_blank">AggieNavs.org</a>! Also, <a href="http://studentactivities.tamu.edu" target="_blank">Student Activities</a> has a list of all on-campus organizations.</p>
</div>

<!-- 29 -->
<button class="collapsible">How should I schedule my day?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>Waking up early is basically a super power, just saying. (<a href="mailto:heyyouIbetyoudidntknowInowofficiallyhavethelongestemailyoucanget@tamu.edu">Ask me about it!</a>). A lot of people prefer morning classes because it gets them up and out. Others are fans of afternoon sections so they can stay out late. Again, I'd recommend experimenting, but I personally have found that evening classes can be pretty rough and make for a long day.</p>
</div>

<!-- 30 -->
<button class="collapsible">What do a lot of successful students do?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>Make your bed every morning. You'd be surprised how much that helps you feel great about the day and be successful.<br>When you get home from somewhere, resist the urge to dump stuff on your bed. Take the minute to put everything where it goes, and you won't have big messes to clean up as much.</p>
</div>

<!-- 31 -->
<button class="collapsible">What can I do on the weekends?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>First of all, have fun! College life is a great time. However, one key to being able to hang with friends is also getting stuff done other times. Make sure you do one thing each day, even if it's just 30 minutes of math homework - commit to getting it done and do it. It's a lot better to do one thing well than to fail at the many things you need to get done. Plus, when you do go out, you'll be able to enjoy yourself and not be one of those people who complain about how much they have to do. Trust me, people will appreciate the lack of complaints. :)</p>
</div>
<br><br>
<h4>Miscellaneous:</h4>
<!-- 32 -->
<button class="collapsible">Where can I get tech help?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>Helpdesk Central is a really cool building. (It's on the right as you leave Commons.) The people are super nice and fairly knowledgeable.</p>
</div>

<!-- 33 -->
<button class="collapsible">Any first day tips?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>Go to the first meeting of every class really early. It stinks to be in a hurry and lost on the first day. If you're early, you get a good seat, you make a good impression, you can be intentional about choosing your groups, and it's a lot cooler in the mornings!</p>
</div>

<!-- 34 -->
<button class="collapsible">Can I bike on campus?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>You definitely can, but be sure to stop at stop signs - students have been known to get tickets for running them.</p>
</div>

<!-- 35 -->
<button class="collapsible">Should I be a 2%er?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>Nope. Go to at least one football game over the next four years. You'll be glad you did, even if you're not a football person. It's a lot of fun, and it makes for a great story..</p>
</div>

<!-- 36 -->
<button class="collapsible">Those emails are fake, right?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>You mean my email addresses? You're a very observant who hovers over hyperlinks! Turns out, I am the proud owner of both <a href="mailto:maroon@tamu.edu" target="_blank">maroon@tamu.edu</a> and <a href="mailto:heyyouIbetyoudidntknowInowofficiallyhavethelongestemailyoucanget@tamu.edu" target="_blank">heyyouIbetyoudidn'tknowInowofficiallyhavethelongestemailyoucanget@tamu.edu</a>. You can get your own on the <a href="directory.tamu.edu" target="_blank"TAMU Directory</a>!</p>
</div>

<!-- 37 -->
<button class="collapsible">How did you make this website?</button>
<div class="content">
  <br><p>This website is actually a text file assembled into valid HTML by a Python parser written by a guy who doesn't know HTML (That's me!). I'm sure the code makes actual devs cry, but I think the site turned out alright :). I came up with the majority of the above content at TAMU Howdy Hack 2019.
