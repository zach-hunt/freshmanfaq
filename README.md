# FreshmanFAQ
FAQ For TAMU Students - this is an ever-growing list of things I wish someone had told me as a freshman. The topics cover everything from Food to Parking to School Supplies and just general Life. I look specifically at how to succeed in school and how to save money doing it. Feel free to reach out with any additional questions!

The backend is a Q&A text file which is assembled into valid HTML by a Python script Zach wrote. Much of the website styling and coloring was chosen and implemented by Harshank.
