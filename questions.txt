Food:
	How many meals do I need?
	Downgrade your meal plan - most people eat less than they expect. I purchased 96 meals first semester and had extras. Plus, they run specials at the end of the year to add more meals/dollars.

	Are the larger meal plans better deals?
	NO! The meals do get cheaper as you buy more, it's true, but it's about a 20 cent difference per meal when you double the number of meals. That's 2%. See "How many meals do I need?", above.

	Where should I eat?
	There are around 45 places to eat on campus. Make <a href="https://www.dineoncampus.com/tamu/dining-map" target="_blank">a list</a> and start checking them out! You'll learn your way around, and you'll find a lot of gems.

	When is food available?
	Dining locations on north campus tend to be open later. You can view hours <a href="https://www.dineoncampus.com/tamu/hours-of-operation" target="_blank">here</a>.

	What kinds of things are available to eat?
	Restaurants have varying menus which you can check out at <a href="https://www.dineoncampus.com/tamu/whats-on-the-menu" target="_blank">dineoncampus.com</a>.

	What are meal trades?
	USELESS*! Don't use them ever. Meals average $11.50, and you're trading them for a meal that would normally cost ~$6 dollars, even including fries, drinks, etc. Not worth it! Use dining dollars anywhere that's not a dining hall (meal swipes are sometimes worth it there: see below).<br><br>*Okay, *usually* useless. Just do the math - they're happy to take a $12 meal trade for $8 of food all day long.

	What are retail swipes?
	They are similar to meal trades, but they give meal trades (see above) a cash value of $7.50. Is that a good deal? Well, you paid about $12 for every meal, so no - that's a terrible deal: you're losing $4.50 every time you use a retail swipe. If you have a lot of excess meals, downgrade your meal plan for a refund and just use dining dollars! (See about Meal Trades above for the cynical version :)

	What about dining halls?
	There are three dining halls on campus: Sbisa (North), Commons (South), and Duncan (Corps). Even at the dining halls, using meals isn't always the best option. Ask the cashiers the dining dollar cost. Typically, it's cheaper to use dining dollars than meals swipes for breakfast, and sometimes lunch. (Dinner is usually worth the meal swipe.) This is a large reason behind why you probably need fewer meals than you think.

	What's up with Duncan Dining Hall?
	Duncan is the dining hall for the Corps of Cadets. Non-corps students can eat there as well (though not every day), and I personally think you should, at least once. It's not the same quality, but it's interesting to see, and it makes for a fun story!

	What's your favorite spot to eat?
	The Grill at the Pavilion - Breakfast Burrito. Served until 10am.<br>Azimuth Cafe in Langford - Tuscan Chicken. Kolaches and fantastic warm sandwiches. (Pro tip: you can order any sandwich on the menu grilled!)<br>Rev's American Grill - Good bean burgers and shakes!

Parking:
	Should I get a parking pass?
	Parking passes are expensive, but you can return your parking pass to Koldus (by Kyle Field and the MSC) at the end of the year for a ~$100 refund! (It's prorated, so the sooner you return it, the more you get back.) (The refund is less for lots than garages, just because you paid less to begin with.) (Your other parking options are covered below - and they're not so great, usually.)

	What are these emails from transportation services?
	Transportation services sends email for every football game. The short story is that South Side Garage doesn't have to move, and most southside lots are probably fine to stay. For other places, you should check the email.

	Where can I park off campus?
	College Station is home to a thriving community of towing services. If you park in the IHOP/Hurricane Harry's parking lot north of Campus, and you're not going to one of those places, you will get towed. It's a great experience... :( (Also, the golf parking lot is off limits.)

School Supplies:
	Where can I get textbooks?
	<a href="http://textbooksolutions.com" target="_blank">TextbookSolutions.com</a> is typically a lot cheaper than the bookstore. Not always, and they don't have everything, but it's right across from campus, so it's definitely worth checking.

	When should I get textbooks?
	In my experience, you don't need actually most of the textbooks listed in your syllabuses. A lot are available electronically (see below about <a href="https://www.cengage.com/unlimited" target="_blank">Cengage Unlimited</a>). It's perfectly fine to wait until the first class period to get your books.

	Can I order my textbooks online?
	You can, but you shouldn't. When you purchase textbooks from Barnes & Noble (the bookstore), they just pack your order from the shelves and make you come pick it up, but it takes several days. Just go downstairs MSC and pick them up the first week of class.

	Where can I get scantrons?
	Scantrons are 42.8% cheaper at the bookstore than the Aggie Expresses. Buy 10, leave 1 in your bag.

	Do I need Cengage Unlimited?
	<a href="https://www.cengage.com/unlimited" target="_blank">Cengage Unlimited</a> (2 Yr.) is almost certainly worth it for you. (Plus, it's $65 cheaper than in 2018!) (This applies to engineers, for sure. Others, do the math - you could save big.)

	Does the bookstore sell other stuff?
	Predictably, TAMU will sell you any merch or school supplies you could possibly want. Also predictably, it's substantially more expensive than Amazon or Walmart. Don't get your calculators or notebooks from there.

	Do I need a new calculator?
	Maybe. A lot of classes will list specific calculator restrictions for exams, but those are frequently just suggestions. Check with your TA/Professor - there's a good chance they'll say what you have is great.

	What other supplies do I need?
	Umbrella. Is that a school supply? Definitely. I'm not joking. You won't need it, and you'll think I'm crazy, right up until the day that it saves your life. Get one.

Academics:
	Any tips for finals?
	I'm glad you asked! If you have more than two finals on one day, you can reschedule at least one of them. (This is <a href="https://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule08/" target="_blank">Student Rule 8.4</a>.) You can check the finals schedule on the <a href="http://registrar.tamu.edu/Courses,-Registration,-Scheduling/Final-Examination-Schedules" target="_blank">Registrar's Website</a>.

	What should I do during the first week?
	The people that have a fun first week have a fun first week. The people that do homework as soon as they get it, just for the first week, have a fun first semester. Up to you, but starting and staying ahead is a lot easier than getting ahead from behind. On the flip side, be sure to explore (get lost on) campus and make friends. They're everwhere!

	Where can I study?
	Everywhere! You'll see people in the fields, on the stairs, in classrooms, in breakout rooms, in the library, in hammocks, in the dining halls, and in their dorms. It seriously pays to see what works for you. Try different things!

	What should I do if I'm behind?
	Apply the 80/20 rule. Identify the most high impact activities (whether studying or homework or whatever), and resolve to do one. Leave your dorm! Otherwise, you'll constantly fall off topic. Seriously, leave. (Also, leave everything you don't need - laptop/phone/tablet. You will survive. It's strangely freeing.). If you feel like you're struggling in general, A&M has a lot of resources to help - they want you to succeed. Talk to your RA or advisor. Most profs are quite helpful as well.

	How do I keep track of my classes?
	Take a screenshot of your schedule. Howdy can and will go down, and you'll be glad you did. A lot of people set their schedule as their phone background.

	How do I contact profs?
	Professor's email addresses are always listed in their syllabus, in the <a href="http://directory.tamu.edu" target="_blank">directory</a>, on <a href="http://howdy.tamu.edu" target="_blank">Howdy</a>, and on the department's website.

	Where are syllabuses?
	Class syllabi are typically posted under your course in eCampus (<a href="https://tamu.blackboard.com" target="_blank">Blackboard</a>), but that can take a while, and they're always in <a href="http://howdy.tamu.edu" target="_blank">Howdy</a>.

	What is ETAM?
	Entry To A Major is a process where engineering freshmen/sophomores are admitted into a major in the department of their choice. It typically occurs around the middle of June, the summer following your freshman year, though it can take longer. For most engineering departments, as of 2020, you will be automatically admitted if your GPA is greater than 3.75 and you have completed all of the necessary core classes (calculus, ENGR 102/216, etc.). Note that, as more students join the College of Engineering, some of the more competitive departments, like CSCE and AERO, will get harder to get into. You can read more <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/academics/undergraduate/entry-to-a-major/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

AP and Dual Credit:
	Should I accept my AP credit from highschool?
	Not necessarily. While they will not count against the 170-Hour Rule (see below), they do count as hours taken in the semester in which you claim them. Thus, if you take 12 hours and claim 3 hours from AP, this can fulfill any scholarship requirements of 15+ hours a semester. If you need the pre-requisites, accept the credit, but if not, you should probably hold off. See below for the process and potential benefits.

	How do I accept my AP credit from highschool?
	That is done through <a href="https://howdy.tamu.edu">Howdy</a>. Click my record (second tab at the top), and then look for Credit By Examination towards the bottom of the Grades and Transcripts Box. If you cannot find it, search the page with cmd/ctrl + f or use the Howdy search bar. From there, select which class(es) you want applied. For help deciding, see the question above and the benefits below.

	Should I accept my Dual Credit from highschool?
	Turns out that all your dual credit is automatically accepted when you get into the school, so you don't need to do anything. Consequences? See below

	Will my AP/Dual Credit cost me out-of-state tuition?
	No. AP/Dual credit earned before entering A&M does not count towards the 170-Hour Rule (see below).

	What is the 170-Hour Rule?
	Once you've taken a certain number of hours from A&M , they will start charging you out of state tuition. This is the <a href="http://registrar.tamu.edu/Catalogs,-Policies-Procedures/State-Policies/Excess-Credit-Hours" target="_blank">170-Hour Rule</a> and it's intended to prevent professional students. In order to be in danger, you have to take 45 hours more than your degree requires (engineering degrees are usually about 130 hours, depending on minors, etc.).

	What are the benefits of accepting AP/Dual Credit?
	Clearly, if you have credit for a required class, you can skip it. AP and dual credit can also be used to fill in pre-reqs or core requirements. Additionally, your classification at A&M is based on your number of credit hours (Freshman U1 < 30, Sophomore U2 < 60, Junior U3 < 90, Senior U4 >=90). This classification matters in three places:<br><br>1) Registration: Upperclassmen get priority registration for classes.<br>2) Ticket pull: Again, Upperclassmen pull football tickets sooner than lower classifications (even if you're pulling for a group of freshmen!)<br>3) Aggie Ring: You need to be a U3 (Junior - 60+ hours) to get your Aggie Ring. 45+ hours must be from A&M, so if you transfer in more than about 5 classes, you can get your ring immediately after your freshman year!.

Life:
	How do I find my way around?
	Get lost intentionally - that's how you avoid doing it accidentally in the future. Also, use <a href="http://aggiemap.tamu.edu" target="_blank">aggiemap.tamu.edu</a> for finding buildings and the very helpful <a href="https://transport.tamu.edu/busroutes/" target="_blank">TAMU Bus Routes</a> to understand the bus system.

	What orgs should I join?
	The Navigators are a great Bible study organization, and we'd love to get you involved. Check out <a href="http://www.AggieNavs.org" target="_blank">AggieNavs.org</a>! Also, <a href="http://studentactivities.tamu.edu" target="_blank">Student Activities</a> has a list of all on-campus organizations.

	How should I schedule my day?
	Waking up early is basically a super power, just saying. (<a href="mailto:heyyouIbetyoudidntknowInowofficiallyhavethelongestemailyoucanget@tamu.edu">Ask me about it!</a>). A lot of people prefer morning classes because it gets them up and out. Others are fans of afternoon sections so they can stay out late. Again, I'd recommend experimenting, but I personally have found that evening classes can be pretty rough and make for a long day.

	What do a lot of successful students do?
	Make your bed every morning. You'd be surprised how much that helps you feel great about the day and be successful.<br>When you get home from somewhere, resist the urge to dump stuff on your bed. Take the minute to put everything where it goes, and you won't have big messes to clean up as much.

	What can I do on the weekends?
	First of all, have fun! College life is a great time. However, one key to being able to hang with friends is also getting stuff done other times. Make sure you do one thing each day, even if it's just 30 minutes of math homework - commit to getting it done and do it. It's a lot better to do one thing well than to fail at the many things you need to get done.<br>Plus, when you do go out, you'll be able to enjoy yourself and not be one of those people who complain about how much they have to do. Trust me, people will appreciate the lack of complaints. :)

Miscellaneous:
	Where can I get tech help?
	Helpdesk Central is a really cool building. (It's on the right as you leave Commons.) The people are super nice and fairly knowledgeable.

	Any first day tips?
	Go to the first meeting of every class really early. It stinks to be in a hurry and lost on the first day. If you're early, you get a good seat, you make a good impression, you can be intentional about choosing your groups, and it's a lot cooler in the mornings!

	Can I bike on campus?
	You definitely can, but be sure to stop at stop signs - students have been known to get tickets for running them.

	Should I be a 2%er?
	Nope. Go to at least one football game over the next four years. You'll be glad you did, even if you're not a football person. It's a lot of fun, and it makes for a great story! :)

	Those emails are fake, right?
	You mean my email addresses? You're a very observant who hovers over hyperlinks! Turns out, I am the proud owner of both <a href="mailto:maroon@tamu.edu" target="_blank">maroon@tamu.edu</a> and <a href="mailto:heyyouIbetyoudidntknowInowofficiallyhavethelongestemailyoucanget@tamu.edu" target="_blank">heyyouIbetyoudidn'tknowInowofficiallyhavethelongestemailyoucanget@tamu.edu</a>. You can get your own on the <a href="https://directory.tamu.edu" target="_blank">TAMU Directory</a>!

	How did you make this website?
	This website is actually a text file assembled into valid HTML by a Python parser written by a guy who doesn't know HTML (That's me!). I'm sure the code makes actual devs cry, but I think the site turned out alright :). I came up with the majority of the above content at TAMU Howdy Hack 2019. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/ZacharyPH/freshmanfaq" target="_blank">GitHub Repository</a> or <a href="mailto:maroon@tamu.edu" target="_blank">send me an email</a> for more details!
