Life:
	Get lost intentionally - that's how you avoid doing it accidentally in the future.

	The Navigators are a great Bible study organization, and we'd love to get you involved. AggieNavs.org

	Waking up early is basically a super power, just saying. (Ask me about it!)

	Make your bed every morning. You'd be surprised how much that helps you feel great about the day and be successful.
	
Food:
	Downgrade your meal plan - most people eat less than they expect. I used 96 meals first semester and had extras. Plus, they run specials at the end of the year to add more meals/dollars.

	There are around 50 places to eat on campus. Make a list and start checking them out! You'll learn your way around, and you'll find a lot of gems.

Parking:
	Return your parking pass at the end of the year for a ~$100 refund. (Less for lots than garages)

School Supplies:
	textbooksolutions.com is typically a lot cheaper than the bookstore.

	Scantrons are 42.8% cheaper at the bookstore than the Aggie Expresses. Buy 10, leave 1 in your bag.

	Cengage Unlimited (2 Yr.) is almost certainly worth it for you. (Plus, it's $65 cheaper than last year!) :)

Miscellaneous:
	Helpdesk Central is a really cool building. (It's on the right as you leave Commons)

	Go to the first meeting of every class really early. It stinks to be in a hurry and lost on the first day. If you're early, you get a good seat, you make a good impression, you can be intentional about choosing your groups, and it's a lot cooler in the mornings!
